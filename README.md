# React-Netflix-Clone
While learning the basics of React to push my JavaScript skills, I wanted to try my hand at a fullstack app. I like Netflix's UI better than other streaming services, so I want to see if I can build something similar. 

TECHNOLOGIES 
React
Node.js
Express.js
AJAX or Fetch API (not sure what I am going to go with yet)

ROADMAP
1.  Create the back-end
      a. create server.js file
      b. set up node and express
      c. load sample data
     
2. Create a login page
   a. start with background
   b. add login modal
   c. add email/password validation
   d. if login is correct, move user to the next screen

3. create movie page
     a. more to come!
