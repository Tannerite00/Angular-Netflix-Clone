# React-Netflix-Clone
While learning the basics of React to push my JavaScript skills, I wanted to try my hand at a fullstack app. I like Netflix's UI better than other streaming services, so I want to see if I can build something similar. 

TECHNOLOGIES:
React
Node.js

Libraries:
React Router: This library will help you with setting up navigation and routing within your application, allowing you to create different pages for browsing movies, viewing details, etc.

Styled Components or Emotion: These libraries allow you to write CSS in JavaScript, making it easier to create and manage styles for your components.

React Icons: To incorporate various icons used in the UI, this library provides a wide range of icons that you can easily integrate.

React Slick: For creating a carousel/slider component to showcase movie posters or featured content, similar to Netflix's main page.

React Modal: This library helps you create modal dialogs, which could be useful for displaying additional information about a movie or showing video trailers.

React Video: To handle video content, this library can help you embed and play videos easily.

Axios or Fetch: You'll need to make API requests to fetch movie data from a source (such as the MovieDB API). Axios and Fetch are popular options for handling HTTP requests.

React Context or Redux: For managing global state and sharing data between components, these libraries can be useful. Redux is more powerful and suitable for larger applications, while React Context is simpler to set up for smaller projects.

React Infinite Scroll Component: If you plan to implement infinite scrolling for movie lists, this component can help you load more movies as the user scrolls down.

React Loading Skeleton: To display loading placeholders while fetching movie data, this library can give your app a more professional appearance.
